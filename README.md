Presentations 

Welcome to the Presentations Repository! This repository contains a collection of PowerPoint presentations (PPTs) related to my internships, seminars, and academic projects. Each folder includes presentations that showcase my research, findings, and insights gained throughout my educational journey.

The repository serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in the topics covered and demonstrates my ability to communicate complex ideas effectively.
